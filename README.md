Low-cost aerial surveillance with full autopilot. Designed for urban environments.

## Abstract

Over the last few decades the issues of overpolicing, and police misconduct have become unavoidably problematic in the United States.
Due to multiple factors, such as qualified immunity, American police officers are enabled to commit acts of violence, theft, and murder with impunity.
As a response to these abuses, the American public has begun to rise against law enforcement organizations engaged in these types of behavior.
True to form, these lawless enforcement agencies continue to commit acts of violence against the very people demanding an end to the violence.

In order to quell unrest, law enforcement departments have adopted a number of strategies for performing mass arrests.
These strategies generally rely on limited visibility from the ground, blinding protesters to the larger movement of law enforcement.
In addition, it is often not possible to record the actions of police officers after they have detained protesters.
To resolve these vulnerabilities, this project aims to provide ultra low-cost aerial surveillance technology for the masses.

## Goals

### Low cost & easy to source parts

* Aircraft SHOULD be as low cost as possible.
* Parts used to build the aircraft MUST be easy to source.
* Part selection and pricing SHOULD be based on amazon listings.

### Easy to build & operate

* All reasonable efforts SHOULD be made to reduce the complexity of building & operating these aircraft.
* Precompiled and ready-to-fly firmware SHOULD be provided for all aircraft/flight controller combinations.
* Complex operations SHOULD be documented in as simple terms as possible.

### Autopilot (waypoints, loitering, and return to home)

* Aircraft in this repository MUST be capable of autopilot.

### Real-time threat mapping

* Results of real-time surveillance SHOULD be publishable to interested parties.
